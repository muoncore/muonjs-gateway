## Muon.js Gateway

This component enables you to run Muon.js services within a browser context and connect them to a full Muon back end network.

Primarily, this allows you to build Muon based rich clients in the browser and make use of the richer protocols Muon provides.

This project provides a websockets based gateway to enable Muon.js services running in the browser to
access the back end Muon systems and interact with them using the rich protocol behaviour that Muon is designed to provide.

The easiest way to get started is to use the muon-starter project, which will start an instance of muonjs-gateway for you.
